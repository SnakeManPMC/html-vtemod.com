<p>
Bug reports are important for VTE to be developed further. We are not looking for anyone to bitch and moan why this or that isn't working etc, we are looking for however a good thorough reports of bugs, issues and anything else worth mentioning which can help us develop VTE further.
</p>

<p>
If you do not wish to register into our forums (its free, no strings attached) for bug reporting, you can send us email also. Make sure you write meaningful subject or otherwise your email could be deleted as spam by accident.
