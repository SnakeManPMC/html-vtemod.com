	<h2>Bra</h2>

<p>
Bra is 12.8km x 12.8km sized terrain.
</p>

<p>
This area was infamous amongst MACV-SOG recon men because of the ferocity of the NVA reception to recon team insertions. The exact location of "The Bra" is somewhat vague. In his excellent book "SOG: The Secret Wars Of America's Commandos in Vietnam", Jonh L. Plaster, himself a former SOG recon team leader, describes "The Bra" as "The river curve where Highway 110 split eastward from the Ho Chi Minh Trail's major north-south route, Highway 96. Across The Bra flowed all NVA troops, supplies and weapons for South Vietnam's Central Highlands and Cambodia's northern half. Hidden in The Bra was the NVA's Binh Tram 37, a major base with stockpiles defended by masses of anti-aircraft guns, security battalions, and counter-recon units. Encompassing targets Juliet Nine, Hotel, India, and November Nine, The Bra was the hottest area in southern Laos".
</p>

<p>
Leghorn Relay Site (The Bra Terrain)
</p>

<p>
Located at YB 604-356 in southeastern Laos. The site was discovered by SOG Lieutenant Grorge K. Sisler. What Sisler had found was a 1,000 meter peak with almost vertical sides, easy to defend. Sisler stated that the site could be used as a SOG radio relay site that would enable recon teams to maintain radio contact with their departing airsupport if an immediate extraction was needed. Sisler said "I am absolutey certain that I could stay on that rock indefinitely".
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the SOG-NSA people managed to hold Leghorn for five years. SOG teams and NSA radio intercept people could monitor a tremendous amount of NVA radio traffic. From their perch on top of Leghorn they could hear NVA truck traffic moving down route 96, some six miles west of Leghorn and a major part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail network.
</p>

<p>
Laotian Binh Tram 37 (The Bra Terrain)
</p>

<p>
Located at approximately YB 625-210. Binh Tram in Vietnamese means (literally) "common-liason site". It is a trans-shipment point, rest stop, and depot for supplies and troops headed down the Ho Chi Minh Trail from North Vietnam into South Vietnam. This facility was heavily defended by large caliber anti-aircraft guns and large numbers of infantry. One SOG recon team-initiated B-52 strike on this complex resulted in secondary explosions that lasted for a full six hours after the strike, evidence of the tremendous quantity of large caliber ammunition that was stored here awaiting trans-shipment into the Central Highlands.
