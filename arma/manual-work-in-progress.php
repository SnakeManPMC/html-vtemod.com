	<h2>Manual Work In Progress Vietnam: The Experience ArmA 1</h2>

<p>
Work in progress (<b>WIP</b>) means its not complete.
</p>

<p>
The latest VTE release is the final Armed Assault (ArmA 1) release, our development continues even though we do not plan on releasing for ArmA 1 anymore (we will release for ArmA 2).
</p>

<p>
WIP contains:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs</li>
<li>Errors</li>
<li>Placeholder units / weapons / vehicles / terrains etc</li>
<li>Several other issues to mention</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE VTE ARMA 1 RELEASE IMMEDIATELY. NOBODY FORCES YOU TO USE THIS VERSION, IF YOU DO, ITS YOUR OWN CHOICE. THANK YOU.</b>
</p>

<p>
Whole purpose of this page is to let users know what they are getting into, this is very WIP version, if you are scared of placeholder stuff and issues, just stay away from this release, please.
</p>

<p>
Please post any feedback you got, for example bug reports. See more details from <a href="bug-reports.php">bug reports</a> page.
</p>

<p>
All in all you'll find VTE ArmA 1 to be very enjoyable, we wouldn't release it otherwise :)
