	<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Shadows are edited and tested with Options -> Shadows: Very High. If you use normal, you most likely get some anomalies. We recommend High or Very High settings</li>
<li>Few terrains in Mapview (M) cause heavy CPU usage; only few terrains when zoomed in and absolutely no effect on 3D view</li>
<li>Kittyhawk carrier works when you put in its mission editor init line (not for BLUFOR, only EMPTY -> VTE Sea)</li>
</ul>
