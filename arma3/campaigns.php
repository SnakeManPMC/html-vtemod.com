</p>

	<h2>Terrain Debug</h2>

<p>
As the name says a debugging campaign, not a playable one. Loads all VTE terrains and has camera cutscene flying across the terrain diagonally. This is nice debug campaign to see if any errors come up with terrains or objects and most importantly if there are any visually wrong. Often times terrain can be error free but its still "wrong" in-game when you play on it.
